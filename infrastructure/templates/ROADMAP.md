# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development path for the MFE Toolbox Python implementation.

The roadmap is organized by planned releases and milestones, with target dates and feature sets for each version.

## Overview

The MFE Toolbox has been completely reimplemented in Python 3.12, replacing the original MATLAB codebase. Version 4.0.0 represents the initial Python release with feature parity to the MATLAB version. The roadmap below outlines the plans for future development, enhancing the Python implementation with new features, optimizations, and integrations.

# MFE Toolbox Security Policy

*Version: 4.0*  
*Supported Python Version: 3.12*  
*Contact: [security@mfe-toolbox.org](mailto:security@mfe-toolbox.org)*

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security policy and guidelines for the MFE Toolbox, an enterprise-grade Python-based suite designed for financial econometrics and advanced time series analysis. In its re-implementation using Python 3.12, the toolbox leverages modern programming constructs such as async/await patterns, strict type hints, data validation mechanisms, Numba JIT optimization, and comprehensive error handling to ensure both high performance and robust security.

The policy detailed herein describes the security controls implemented in the system, the procedures for reporting vulnerabilities, and the practices adhered to during development and maintenance. This document is intended for developers, security engineers, and stakeholders to ensure that all security aspects of the toolbox are transparent and consistently maintained.

## 2. Supported Versions and Update Policy

The MFE Toolbox is developed with the following version and update policies:

- **Python Compatibility:** The toolbox is fully compatible with Python **3.12**.
- **Security Patches:** All security patches and critical updates are delivered via standard pip package updates.
- **Version Deprecation:** A regular version deprecation schedule is maintained to phase out legacy versions in favor of secure, updated implementations.
- **Configuration Tools:**
  - **Mypy:** The static type checker is configured in `infrastructure/config/mypy.ini` with `strict = True` and `python_version = 3.12` to enforce type safety.
  - **Bandit:** Python security scanning is performed using Bandit (version 1.7.5) as per settings in `infrastructure/config/bandit.yml` with a confidence-level of **HIGH** and a severity-level of **MEDIUM**.

## 3. Vulnerability Reporting Procedure

To ensure continued system integrity, all security vulnerabilities must be reported in a timely and responsible manner:

- **Reporting Channel:** Submit vulnerability reports via email to [security@mfe-toolbox.org](mailto:security@mfe-toolbox.org).
- **Expected Response Times:** The security team aims to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 10 business days.
- **Disclosure Policy:** Vulnerabilities will be investigated thoroughly and, when appropriate, disclosed publicly once mitigations are in place, according to a coordinated disclosure policy.
- **Bug Bounty Program:** A bug bounty program may be offered to reward researchers who uncover critical vulnerabilities. Details of eligibility and reward structures will be communicated by the security team.

## 4. Security Controls and Measures

The following security controls have been implemented to safeguard the MFE Toolbox:

- **Input Validation:**
  - All externally supplied data and parameters are rigorously validated using Python’s strict type checking and custom validation routines.
  - This prevents malicious or malformed inputs from affecting system operations.

- **Memory Safety:**
  - The Python runtime’s managed memory and garbage collection systems ensure that all objects are safely allocated and deallocated.
  - Array operations use NumPy’s robust buffer management to mitigate risks of memory corruption.

- **Numerical Computation Security:**
  - High-performance numerical routines are implemented using Numba with JIT compilation.
  - Bounds checking and overflow protection are enforced in all critical computations.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - Comprehensive error handling using Python’s `try/except` blocks ensures that exceptions are caught, logged, and managed without exposing sensitive information.
  - The logging framework is configured to record detailed error information for auditing and debugging.

- **Static Analysis:**
  - Static code analysis is performed with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) (version 1.7.0) to enforce type hints and detect potential errors early.
  - This rigorous checking reduces the risk of runtime errors and security vulnerabilities.

- **Security Scanning:**
  - Continuous security scanning is executed using [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) (version 1.7.5) configured for high confidence and medium severity.
  - The configuration settings are maintained in `infrastructure/config/bandit.yml`, ensuring that any potential security weaknesses are identified and remediated promptly.

## 5. Configuration Settings for Security Tools

**Bandit Configuration:**

- **Location:** `infrastructure/config/bandit.yml`
- **Key Settings:**
  - `confidence-level`: **HIGH**
  - `severity-level`: **MEDIUM**
  - Additional parameters ensure recursive scanning and comprehensive output in JSON format for analysis.

**Mypy Configuration:**

- **Location:** `infrastructure/config/mypy.ini`
- **Key Settings:**
  - `strict = True`
  - `python_version = 3.12`
  - These settings enforce strict type checking to catch type-related issues during development.

## 6. Development Security Practices

The MFE Toolbox is developed following strict security practices to ensure code quality and system integrity:

- **Code-Level Security:**
  - Use of robust error handling, logging, and clean, modular code implementation.
  - Global and local exceptions are managed to prevent leakage of sensitive information.

- **Static Analysis:**
  - Enforced typing using Python’s type hints with mypy.
  - Code is subjected to static analysis during the continuous integration process to ensure compliance with secure coding standards.

- **Security Scanning:**
  - Automated security scans using bandit are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Any vulnerabilities found are resolved promptly following established guidelines.

- **Version Control and Dependency Management:**
  - The codebase is maintained under strict version control.
  - Regular reviews are conducted to update dependencies and apply security patches.

---

## 7. Policy Maintenance and Updates

- **Regular Reviews:** This security policy is reviewed regularly to incorporate new security practices and address emerging threats.
- **Update Procedures:** All security updates, patches, and revisions are documented and communicated through the standard release process.
- **Change Control:** The version deprecation schedule is maintained to ensure that outdated components are replaced promptly, minimizing exposure to security vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Tools:** Both static analysis (mypy) and security scanning (bandit) are part of the automated build and deployment process to continuously monitor for security issues.
